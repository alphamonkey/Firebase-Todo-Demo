# Firebase-Todo-Demo

## Project Description
  Firebase-Todo-Demo is a native iOS app that implements a simple to-do list.  To-Do lists are stored on the Firebase platform and can be shared across multiple devices.  The application supports authentication with multiple providers, and data is not shared between users.  Users can set a priority and a due date for to-do items, as well as upload a photo that describes the task.  
 
  The purpose of this app is to demonstrate proficiency with the following technologies:
  * Mobile App Development
  * Native iOS Development
  * SwiftUI
  * MVVM architecture
  * Camera / Photo library integration
  * Firebase
     - Firestore
     - Firebase storage
     - Firebase analytics
     - Firebase authentication with the following providers
        * Github
        * Google Sign-In
        * Email / Password
  


  Future enhancements may include adding additional authentication providers, subtasks, multiple to-do lists and sharing lists with other users.
